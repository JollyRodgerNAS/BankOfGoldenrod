This is a WinForms bank application using MySQL as a database. It is for the use of bank tellers to create account holders, manage funds of account holders and also close accounts. After BankOfGoldenrod is complete I will make a second application to compliment BankOfGoldenrod, which will be meant for account holder use, as opposed to BankOfGoldenrod's intended use which is for bank tellers. It will connect to the same database as the BankOfGoldenrod application and allow account holders to manage their funds themselves.
